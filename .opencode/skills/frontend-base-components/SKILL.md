## Activation Contract

Use when creating or reviewing reusable frontend components such as fields, dialogs/modals, tables, pagination, or shared interaction primitives.

## Hard Rules

- Create a base only for a stable behavior with demonstrated consumers; do not manufacture abstractions for hypothetical reuse or boilerplate reduction alone.
- Preserve layers: `base` owns generic presentation/accessibility, `composed` combines bases, and `specialized` adds feature-specific behavior.
- Expose explicit, typed props and controlled state contracts. Base components must not know business rules, HTTP, domain models, or form-library state.
- Put integration in separate adapters (for example RHF), without duplicating base markup, styling, or behavior.
- Cover accessible names, labels, keyboard/focus behavior, and relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and permission states. Test behavior, not implementation.
- Add shared components to the development catalog with variants, states, and usage examples.
- `PasswordField` is the reusable controlled password base at `src/app/shared/components/fields/base/PasswordField.tsx`; it composes `Input` and `Label`, owns only local visibility state, and exposes `value`, `onChange`, `required`, `disabled`, `error`, and `helperText` states. Feature-specific validation and form-library integration belong in adapters or specialized wrappers.
- For file fields controlled by or adapted to RHF, do not combine the native `required` attribute with clearing the file input after selection. Validate requiredness in the schema/adapter and communicate it through `aria-required` and the visual error state.

## Decision Gates

| Evidence                                      | Action                                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Existing component fits                       | Reuse or compose it                              |
| One module owns the behavior                  | Keep it in that module                           |
| Multiple real consumers share stable behavior | Create or adapt a base                           |
| Only data/business differs                    | Use props, composition, or a specialized wrapper |

## Execution Steps

1. Search existing components and record why reuse or adaptation is insufficient.
2. Define scope, explicit props, states, accessibility contract, and consumer examples.
3. Implement the smallest layer; isolate adapters and feature logic.
4. Add focused tests and catalog coverage, then run lint, typecheck, tests, and build.

## Output Contract

Report consumers, chosen layer, public props, excluded concerns, accessibility/states, tests, catalog entry, and validation results.
